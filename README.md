## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

> This library provides facilities for basic binary value packing and unpacking.
>
> The Pickle class supports appending primitive values (ints, strings, etc.) to a pickle instance. The Pickle instance
> grows its internal memory buffer dynamically to hold the sequence of primitive values. The internal memory buffer is
> exposed as the "data" of the Pickle. This "data" can be passed to a Pickle object to initialize it for reading.
>
> When reading from a Pickle object, it is important for the consumer to know what value types to read and in what order
> to read them as the Pickle does not keep track of the type of data written to it.
>
> The Pickle's data has a header which contains the size of the Pickle's payload.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

This library doesn't have many requirements, so here's what you need:

```
Dart SDK >=2.18.0
```

### Installing

Just run it and now you're ready to rock

```
dart pub add chromium_pickle
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Here is a basic application using pickles

```dart
import 'package:chromium_pickle/chromium_pickle.dart';

void main() {
  // Create empty pickle
  var pickle = Pickle.empty();

  // Write value to pickle
  pickle.writeInt(25565);

  // Create iterator
  var iterator = pickle.createIterator();

  // Print current pickle value
  print(iterator.readInt());

  // Print buffer content
  print(buffer.toUint8List());
}

```
